1. Arriving Customer (Groups)
2. Seating (Table, Oval, Bar)

Query how many options are available for a given group size.
Determine who has been waiting the longest maybe? Possible strategy...

Triggers:
	Group Arrival
	Group Departure (Open table)

Groups are assigned departure times once they are seated! In the real world this is not possible; however, this is possible/used for the project.
